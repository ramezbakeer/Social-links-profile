## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I practice on CSS grid with I made the buttons session with grid and some other properties 


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .card .buttons {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 80%;
    gap: 15px;
    justify-content: center;
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
}
```



### Continued development

I need to make the buttons clickable not only the anchor tag


### Useful resources

- [CSS grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me for learning CSS Grid concept.
- [Grid garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) - This is an amazing game which helped me finally understand CSS Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
